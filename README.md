# PageRank in timely dataflow

This repository contains an implementation of the PageRank algorithm in timely
dataflow, implemented in Rust. By default, it runs 20 PageRank iterations and
then prints some statistics.

To run, clone the repo, prepare the inputs and run. We assume that you have a
working Rust installation, and that your input graph is in text-based edge list
format.

## Preparing the inputs

The input format for our PageRank implementation is a binary-packed adjacency
list for a graph. You can use the `parse` binary to transform an ASCII/UTF-8
edge list into this format:
```
$ cargo run --release --bin parse -- my-edgelist.txt my-graph
```
This will generate binary files `my-graph.offsets` and `my-graph.targets`,
which can be the used as inputs to the `pagerank` binary.

`parse` assumes that the inputs are in tab-seperated text, but you can change
to a different delimiter by editing `src/bin/parse.rs`. For a small example
data set that works out of the box, use the
[LiveJournal graph](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-LiveJournal1.txt.gz).
A single-threaded iteration on this graph takes about 0.67s on a 2013 MacBook
Air.

to the larger `twitter_rv` and `uk_2007_05` data sets.

## Running PageRank
To run on inputs `my-graph.offsets` and `my-graph.targets`, run:
```
$ cargo run --release --bin pagerank -- my-graph worker [options]
```
The `worker` argument indicates you would like worker-level aggregation.
You can alternately use `process` for process-level aggregation.

Without any options, the code runs single-threadedly. The `-w` option can be
used to set the number of threads to use; `-h`,`-n` and `-p` can be used to
run distributedly:
```
$ cat hosts.txt
hostname0:port
hostname1:port
hostname2:port
hostname3:port

hostname0$ cargo run --release --bin pagerank -- my-graph -h hosts.txt -n 4 -p 0
hostname1$ cargo run --release --bin pagerank -- my-graph -h hosts.txt -n 4 -p 1
hostname2$ cargo run --release --bin pagerank -- my-graph -h hosts.txt -n 4 -p 2
hostname3$ cargo run --release --bin pagerank -- my-graph -h hosts.txt -n 4 -p 3
```
The inputs must already be present in the working directory on all hosts.

## Context

We have written [blog](http://www.frankmcsherry.org/pagerank/distributed/performance/2015/07/08/pagerank.html)
[posts](http://camsas.org/blog/2015-07-08-timely-pagerank-part1.html) about the
development of this implementation; there, we also compare it against the widely
used [GraphX system](https://spark.apache.org/graphx/) for Apache Spark.
